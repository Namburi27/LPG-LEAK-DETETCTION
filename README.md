# LPG-LEAK-DETETCTION
This is a project that detects LPG using a MQ-2 sensor and sends an alert message to the registered mobile number. In addition, when gas is detected, this device may automatically turn off the power supply.
The MQ 2 gas sensor detects or monitors the concentration of a gas.
Because of its high hydrogen sensitivity, it can detect LPG (liquid petroleum gas), methane, carbon monoxide, alcohol, smoke, and propane.
